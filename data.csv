Very cute pictures, easy and fun games for my 2 year old to play. Anytime I want a new kids game for my daughter I will be checking to see what games you offer first. The only thing I would suggest is for the app to remember what toys/stickers she collects for completing puzzles. I dont think she minds, but I think it's a bit of a bummer to lose her collection anytime she exits the game\n"",""My 3 in October great grandson all the time wants to play \""my puzzle game\"". He progressed to doing more complexity in number of pieces. Then went back to doing some of the simpler ones. He is encouraged by the sounds he is rewarded with on solving some pics and delights in winning another trophy for his work. I love that there are no ads and no in game expense. Games that do that are only trying to exploit these young innocent children. Thank you so much for putting the children's needs 1st.\n"",""I love the puzzles game more my frd told me to play . Thank u to give jisgaw puzzles game it is world famous game . Right. It is not good game so bad game i am not happy with this game u have to change little\n"",""Thank you so much for the app, my nephew's going to like this. There's only one minor problem in my opinion; when you solve a puzzle or drag an object, etc., the lion reads the name of the object aloud, and that's your only chance to hear it; not very convenient for a kid that has never heard the word before. The lion should read the word again when you tap on the object so that the kid can understand and repeat a word a few times if necessary.\n"",""LOVE this app and all the other app created that goes together. when I was looking for a learning that does not only give limited learning activities, this app popped out from no where and I thought it was joke. but I gabe it a try for my daughter when she was 1 years old, now she is 4 years old and learned her alphabets from her and shapes and learned how to put puzzles together here. so when we go to a big store all she wanted to buy is shoes and puzzles. which I don't mind getting.\n"",""Just the best for my granddaughter and myself!   I started with Baby Games when my granddaughter was 14 months and she is now 2 1/2 years old.  The whole family cannot believe how far she has grown.  She asks Grandpa every day to \""Paint\"" which means she wants to paint, do puzzles and so much more.  Your design is so easy to use, fun for my granddaughter to use and she is learning so fast!  Thank you, Thank you!\n"",""I'm not one to leave comments or ratings even when I like an app but I'll make exception for this app. I was super impressed by not only the high quality of the app itself, but the focus the team puts on educating kids. we definitely love this app and appreciate what you're doing. I definitely recommend this app to anyone with kids. One more thing! I love that this app has no ads because my little one kept pressing the ads on the other educational apps and it was a pain in the butt.\n"",""Excellent üòä my daughter learning a lot and have a fun with your app, the multi languages option is great for kids to learn and understand differents languages at young age.
