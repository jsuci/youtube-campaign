Make the pitcher a little bit taller and make it a bit thinner because it kinda looks weird and that is all i have to say. Thanks for tour game, your games are the BEST&#x1F44C;.,Awesome! IT should be for 3-15 bc its a really fun game! It&#x27;s offline and I love it! I wish more of the apps are free but it&#x27;s not!
